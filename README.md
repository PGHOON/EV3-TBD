# EV3-TBD

current implemented operation:<br/>
  -socket connection between EV3 and PC(tested environment: Mac m2)<br/>
  -Send the image file(jpg) to PC from EV3 and save it to PC<br/>
  -Predict what fruit it is from the picture received from EV3<br/>
  /*I have a dataset that I used to assign in class, so I just did it as a fruit,<br/>
  but I can replace it with another dataset as much as I want. It's not a big deal*/<br/>
  -wifi-connection<br/>
  -fswebcam installed
  
subsequent phase:<br/>
  -modify to take and send image file in real time on EV3, rather than send pre-stored images<br/>
  -TBD...<br/>
