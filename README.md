# EV3-TBD

current implemented operation:\n
  -socket connection between EV3 and PC(tested environment: Mac m2)\n
  -Send the image file(jpg) to PC from EV3 and save it to PC\n
  -Predict what fruit it is from the picture received from EV3\n
  /*I had a dataset that I used to assign in class, so I just did it as a fruit,\n
  but I can replace it with another dataset as much as I want. It's not a big deal*/\n\n
  
subsequent phase:\n
  -modify to take and send image file in real time on EV3, rather than send pre-stored images\n
  -TBD...\n
