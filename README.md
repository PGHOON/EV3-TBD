# EV3-TBD

current implemented operation:
  -socket connection between EV3 and PC(tested environment: Mac m2)
  -Send the image file(jpg) to PC from EV3 and save it to PC
  -Predict what fruit it is from the picture received from EV3
  /*I had a dataset that I used to assign in class, so I just did it as a fruit,
  but I can replace it with another dataset as much as I want. It's not a big deal*/
  
subsequent phase:
  -modify to take and send image file in real time on EV3, rather than send pre-stored images
  -TBD...
